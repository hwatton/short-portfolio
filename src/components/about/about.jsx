        <p>I've worked in the fine art industry for about 15 years, as an artist, fabricator, project manager, designer and basically anything else that happened to be my job on that day.</p>
       <p>In the past 3 or 4 years, I've been working more and more with digital art, programming and now, mostly in web design.</p>
        <p>I started by programming cells in Excel via macros/VBA and now I mostly work in Javascript and often with d3.js and React.</p>
        <p>My favourite projects are problem solving for a particular graphic effect, or programmatically making visualisations with data.</p>
        <p>I've got lots to learn still, I'm always finding new HTML elements and CSS patterns to do the jobs I've been previously hacking in JS, but I like a challenge and I love to learn new things. So it's all working out so far.</p>
        <br />
        <p>This site is deployed by Netlify CI, so I had to learn that I guess.</p>
